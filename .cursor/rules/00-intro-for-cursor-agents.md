# Introduction for Cursor AI Agents

Welcome to the Quickstand project. This file provides guidance for Cursor AI agents to effectively contribute to this project.

## Project Purpose

Quickstand is a CLI tool designed to help developers create status updates by:
- Fetching git logs across multiple repositories
- Managing "standup" entries for tracking work
- Generating human-readable status updates using AI

## How to Use These Rules

These Cursor rules serve as quick references that point to the comprehensive documentation in the `docs` directory. When working on this project:

1. Use these rules as initial guidance
2. For detailed information, follow the links to the documentation files
3. Always maintain the `docs` directory as the single source of truth

## Rule Files in This Directory

- `00-intro-for-cursor-agents.md` - This introduction file
- `01-project-overview.md` - General project overview
- `02-code-standards.md` - Code standards and style guidelines
- `03-architecture-patterns.md` - Architecture patterns and principles
- `04-testing-guidelines.md` - Testing practices
- `05-ai-integration.md` - AI integration guidelines

## Main Documentation Files

All detailed guidance is found in the `docs` directory:

- [Project Guidelines](../../docs/project-guidelines.md)
- [Getting Started](../../docs/getting-started.md)
- [Architecture Guide](../../docs/architecture.md)
- [Code Style Guide](../../docs/code-style-guide.md)
- [AI Agent Guide](../../docs/ai-agent-guide.md)

## Workflow for Development

When adding features or fixing bugs:

1. Start by understanding the requirements and exploring existing code
2. Follow the project's architecture patterns and code standards
3. Implement changes with comprehensive tests
4. Reference the detailed documentation for specific guidance

## Important Notes

- This project has no frontend components - it's a CLI tool only
- Commander.js is used for CLI command structure
- All code should be written in TypeScript with proper type annotations
- Tests should be written using Vitest

For any project-specific questions, consult the detailed documentation files.
