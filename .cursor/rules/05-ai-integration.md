# Quickstand AI Integration Guidelines

This rule provides a quick reference to key AI integration concepts. For complete details, refer to the documentation.

## Documentation References

All AI integration information is found in:
- [Architecture Guide](../../docs/architecture.md) - AI Integration Architecture section
- [AI Agent Guide](../../docs/ai-agent-guide.md) - AI Integration section

## Key AI Integration Principles

1. **Abstraction**: Use interfaces to hide implementation details of AI providers
2. **Templating**: Use prompt templates for consistent AI interactions
3. **Type Safety**: Implement structured responses with validation
4. **Fallbacks**: Include graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

## Data Privacy Considerations

- Don't send sensitive information to external AI services
- Sanitize commit messages before sending to AI
- Provide options for users to review data before sending to AI

For detailed implementation examples, patterns, and code structures for AI integration, refer to the documentation linked above.
