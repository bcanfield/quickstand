# Quickstand Code Standards for AI Code Generation

When generating code for the Quickstand project, always refer to the complete [Code Style Guide](../../docs/code-style-guide.md) for detailed standards.

## Documentation References

The authoritative source for all code standards is the [Code Style Guide](../../docs/code-style-guide.md). This document is just a quick reference.

## Key Standards to Remember

- Use TypeScript with explicit type annotations
- Follow CLI-specific patterns for command structure
- Use dependency injection for services
- Place test files next to source files with `.test.ts` extension
- Organize imports in groups: built-in modules, external dependencies, internal modules
- Implement proper error handling, especially for CLI commands

For all code examples, patterns, and detailed guidelines, refer to:
- [Code Style Guide](../../docs/code-style-guide.md)
- [Architecture Guide](../../docs/architecture.md)
